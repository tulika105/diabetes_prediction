# Diabetes_prediction
The project aims at predicting diabetes of individuals by harnessing the power of machine learning. The dataset has been taken from kaggle. It has 1 lakh rows and 9 columns.
The methodology used in the project begins with data collection from Kaggle website, after that data preprocessing has been done followed by exploratory data analysis where univariate analysis is performed through histogram, count plot, box plot and bivariate analysis through heatmap showing correlation between variables. Different sampling techniques has been used to balance the classes. Four different ML algorithms such as Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Extreme Gradient Boosting and Support Vector Machines out of which, Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGboost) turns out to be the best algorithm with an accuracy of 95%.
